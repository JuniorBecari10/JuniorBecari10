# Hi, Iâ€™m JuniorBecari10 ðŸ˜ƒ

I like programming things in Java, like games and regular programs to supply my needs. Now learning some new languages, like JavaScript and TypeScript, and for the future, like C and Assembly. I love Operating Systems.

My real statistics are not here why my main repositories are private. You are now seeing my statistics for my **public** repositories.

Love to make new friends! ðŸ˜ƒ
